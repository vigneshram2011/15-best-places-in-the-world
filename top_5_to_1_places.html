                Bora Bora (French: Bora-Bora; Tahitian: Pora Pora) is an island group in the Leeward Islands. The
                Leeward Islands comprise the western part of the Society Islands of French Polynesia, which is an
                overseas collectivity of the French Republic in the Pacific Ocean. Bora Bora has a total land area of
                30.55 km2 (12 sq mi). The main island, located about 230 kilometres (143 miles) northwest of Papeete, is
                surrounded by a lagoon and a barrier reef. In the center of the island are the remnants of an extinct
                volcano, rising to two peaks, Mount Pahia and Mount Otemanu; the highest point is at 727 metres (2,385
                feet). Bora Bora is part of the Commune of Bora-Bora, which also includes the atoll of Tūpai. The
                languages spoken in Bora Bora are Tahitian and French. However, due to the high tourism population, many
                natives of Bora Bora have learned to speak English.

                The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art
                in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by
                many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal
                attracts 7-8 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the
                World (2000-2007) initiative.

                Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel, located in the Cusco Region of Peru. It was the
                largest Inca citadel in the world until the Spanish Conquest of the 15th century. The ruins of the
                citadel are located in the Cusco Region, in the Urubamba Province, which is in the Sacred Valley,
                Urubamba District, in the Urubamba Region.

                Victoria Falls is a waterfall on the Zambezi River in southern Africa, which provides habitat for
                several unique species of plants and animals. It is located on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe
                and is one of the world's largest waterfalls, with a width of 1,708 m (5,604 ft). While it is neither
                the highest nor the widest waterfall in the world, the Victoria Falls are classified the largest, based
                on its combined width of 1,708 metres (5,604 ft) and height of 108 metres (354 ft), resulting in
                the world's largest sheet of falling water. The Victoria Falls are roughly twice the height of North
                America's Niagara Falls and well over twice its width.

                The Highlands is a region of Iceland that is home to the largest number of glaciers in the world. The
                Highlands are located in the southwest of Iceland, between the islands of Eyjafjallajökull and
                Höfn. The Highlands are the most remote part of the country, with a total area of about 1,000,000
                square kilometres (4,000,000 sq mi). The Highlands are the only part of Iceland that is not covered by
                the national park system.
