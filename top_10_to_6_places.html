                Reed Flute Cave is a natural limestone cave in the Guangxi province of China. Its name is derived from a
                variety of naturally abundant reed that grows throughout the area, which can be used to make flutes. The
                Reed Flute Cave boasts bodies of water, extraordinary stalagmite and stalactite formations, as well as a
                number of ink inscriptions dating back to the 8th century. The sheer number of rock formations, paired
                with their variance in form and color, has led to the cave being deemed “The Palace of Natural Arts”.

                The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and
                other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of
                China to protect the Chinese states and empires against attacks by various nomadic groups who have
                encroached on the Chinese mainland. The Great Wall is the only surviving remnant of the Great Barrier
                Reef.

                Plitvice Lakes National Park (Croatian: Nacionalni park Plitvička jezera, colloquially Plitvice,
                pronounced [plîtuitse]) is one of the oldest and largest national parks in Croatia. In 1979, Plitvice
                Lakes National Park was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list, due to its outstanding and
                picturesque series of tufa lakes, caves, connected by waterfalls. The national park was founded in 1949
                and is in the mountainous karst area of central Croatia, at the
                border to Bosnia and Herzegovina. The important north-south road that passes through the national park
                area connects the Croatian inland with the Adriatic coastal region.

                The Great Blue Hole is a giant marine sinkhole off the coast of Belize. It lies near the center of
                Lighthouse Reef, a small atoll 70 km (43 mi) from the mainland and Belize City. The hole is circular in
                shape, 318 m (1,043 ft) across and 124 m (407 ft) deep. It has a surface area of 70,650 square metres
                (760,500 sq ft). It was formed during several episodes of quaternary glaciation when sea levels were
                much lower. Analysis of stalactites found in the Great Blue Hole shows that formation took place
                153,000, 66,000, 60,000, and 15,000 years ago. As the ocean began to rise again, the cave was
                flooded. The Great Blue Hole is a part of the larger Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System, a UNESCO
                World Heritage Site.

            6. The Yellowstone National Park, United States of America

                Yellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468.4 sq mi (8,983 km2),[ comprising lakes, canyons,
                rivers, and mountain ranges. Yellowstone Lake is one of the largest high-elevation lakes in North
                America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest supervolcano on the continent. The
                caldera is considered a dormant volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last
                two million years. Well over half of the world's geysers and hydrothermal features are
                in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover
                most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem,
                the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone. In 1978,
                Yellowstone was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
